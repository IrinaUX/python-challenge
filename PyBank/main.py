# Define a function to count total number of months.
'''
This function takes the path variable defined outside the function as an input.
With provided path, open the csv file using "with" method to avoid issues, when forgetting to close the file.
Open csv file in read mode and optional parameter newline default to null.
Open csv file as "file_input".
Use iter() method to iterate through each row in the csv file.
Use next() method to skip the header line.
Use list comprehension to sum up the numbers of rows.
Print the found months.
Create text file named output.txt in write mode (also create new file, if does not exist).
Write first line.
Write new lines.

The function takes path parameter as an input.
Open file in read mode.
Use csv reader method to read the file line by line
Use next() method to skip the header.
Define profit_list parameter as empty list.
Loop through the csv object and append the value from column 2 (index[1] in the array).
At the same time, define the value as data type integer.
Use sum method on the profit_list to obtain the total revenue.
At the same time, round the sum value.

# Define a function to calculate the average change in revenue.
'''
The function takes path parameter as an input and perform the following:
Open file in read mode.
Use csv reader method to read the file line by line.
Use next() method to skip the header.
Define two variables to store current and previous values to calculate the change.
Initialize both variables as None to use in the conditional statements.
When values are still in their initial state, then assign the current values.
When both values are available, then compute the difference.
Print to the console.
Note: still working on how to make the last row to be taken into the computation loop.
Note: currently the loop does not take the last row into the computation.
